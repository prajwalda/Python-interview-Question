1. **What is `__init__`?**  
   `__init__` is a special method in Python classes, called a constructor. It initializes the object when it’s created, setting up initial values for attributes.

2. **What is the difference between Python arrays and lists?**  
   Arrays can only store items of the same data type, while lists can store items of different types. Lists are more commonly used in Python because they are more flexible.

3. **How can you make a Python script executable on Unix?**  
   Add a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) at the start of the script and make it executable with `chmod +x script.py`.

4. **What is slicing in Python?**  
   Slicing is used to access a portion of a sequence (like a list or string) by specifying a start and end index, e.g., `my_list[1:4]`.

5. **What is a docstring in Python?**  
   A docstring is a special string used to describe a function, class, or module. It’s written inside triple quotes (`"""..."""`) right after the definition.

6. **What are unit tests in Python?**  
   Unit tests are tests for individual parts (or “units”) of a program, helping ensure each part works correctly. Python's `unittest` module is often used for this.

7. **What is `break`, `continue`, and `pass` in Python?**  
   - `break`: Exits a loop entirely.
   - `continue`: Skips the current loop iteration and moves to the next.
   - `pass`: Does nothing and is used as a placeholder.

8. **What is the use of `self` in Python?**  
   `self` represents the instance of a class and allows access to its attributes and methods within the class.

9. **What are global, protected, and private attributes in Python?**  
   - Global: Accessible anywhere in the program.
   - Protected: Should only be accessed within the class and subclasses (conventionally prefixed with `_`).
   - Private: Restricted to the class itself (prefixed with `__`).

10. **What are modules and packages in Python?**  
    A module is a single Python file with code, while a package is a collection of modules organized in directories. Packages often include an `__init__.py` file.

11. **What is `pass` in Python?**  
    `pass` is a statement that does nothing, often used as a placeholder in code where some action will be added later.

12. **What are the common built-in data types in Python?**  
    Common data types include integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), strings (`str`), lists, tuples, dictionaries (`dict`), and sets.

13. **What are lists and tuples? What is the key difference between the two?**  
    Lists are mutable sequences, and tuples are immutable sequences. This means you can modify lists but not tuples after they’re created.

14. **What is Scope in Python?**  
    Scope refers to the region in a program where a variable is accessible, such as local, global, or nonlocal scopes.

15. **What is PEP 8, and why is it important?**  
    PEP 8 is a style guide for Python code, promoting readability and consistency across Python projects.

16. **What is an Interpreted language?**  
    An interpreted language is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime, making it easier to debug but often slower than compiled languages.

17. **What is a dynamically typed language?**  
    In a dynamically typed language like Python, variable types are determined at runtime, meaning you don’t need to declare types explicitly.

18. **What is Python?**  
    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, ease of use, and wide range of applications, from web development to data science.

del is used to delete attrubute in class
ex - del s1.name
